# Python-based-polymer-unit-recognition-script-PURS-2.0
1.High throughput identification of polymer-units(repeating units) from SMILES codes of polymers

2.GNN models based on polymer-unit - Model acceleration and interpretative enhancement

### Installation
#### 1.Use only the recognition function
```
conda create -n PURS
conda activate PURS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2.Interpretable GNNS based on polymer-units
